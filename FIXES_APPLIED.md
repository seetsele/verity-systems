## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

**Solution:**
- Upgraded border thickness: 1px → 2px

- Implemented proper shadow styling: `box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);`
- Enhanced hover effects with color transition: `rgba(0, 217, 255, 0.2)` to `0.6)`
- Improved featured card styling with gradient background
- Added checkmark icons (✓) to feature lists
- Made pricing badge more prominent with gradient background
- Fixed card height to fill space with `flex-direction: column` + `height: 100%`

**Files Modified:** `public/assets/css/styles-dark.css` (lines 1030-1155)

**Visual Changes:**
```
Before: Subtle borders, weak hover effect, inconsistent sizing
After:  Bold 2px borders, gradient accents, consistent sizing, 
        smooth animations, prominent featured card
